# cycles
Creation of a digital music instrument based on cyclical concepts of music using plant growth algorithms.

## Concept
** Cycles explores the musical concepts of cyclical music through generative Max-MSP patches. These patches attempt to musically interpret the algorithmic botany research done at the University of Calgary, while also musically inspiring itself from artists such as Steve Reich and non-western musical approaches such as Gamelan and Sufi music.
Currently, this program makes use of the flucoma library and patches, and was initially built on Frederico Foderaro's mc. granulator. By using Flucoma's concatenative synthesis and Max-MSP's mc. wrapper, I can interpret a large range of information and musical possibilities. In order to make these accessible through interaction, I am also using wekinator to consolidate the extreme dimensions in latent space.

### Software needed

In order to run the patches you need
**Max 8.6.0 or later

### Library needed

Cycles uses the Fluid Corpus Manipulation library to do its sound analysis.
At the moment, FluCoMa needs to be installed independantly in Max. To do so :

Open Max
In the "File" menu, go to "Show Package Manager"
Find the Fluid Corpus Manipulation Library in the list and click on it
Install the library
Quit and restart both Max and Ableton Live for all dependancies to work properly

### How to run

Coming soon
